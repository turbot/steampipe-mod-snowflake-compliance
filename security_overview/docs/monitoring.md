## Monitoring

You can monitor the usage of Snowflake to meet your organizationâ€™s audit and compliance requirements.

Every Snowflake account comes with a system-defined, read-only shared database named `SNOWFLAKE`. It has a schema named `ACCOUNT_USAGE` containing views that provide access to one year of audit logs, sessions, login history, etc.
