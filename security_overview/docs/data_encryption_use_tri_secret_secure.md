## Description

[Tri-Secret Secure](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-encryption-manage.html#tri-secret-secure) is the combination of a Snowflake-maintained key and a customer-managed key in the cloud provider platform that hosts your Snowflake account to create a composite master key to protect your Snowflake data. The composite master key acts as an account master key and wraps all of the keys in the hierarchy.
